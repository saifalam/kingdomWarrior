# **KINGDOM WARRIOR**
Wlelcome to the Kingdom Warrior. This is a very simple command line game. But it can easily be used for GUI versions.

## **Brief Introduction:**

Every one wants to rule the seven kingdom. To become a ruler of seven kingdom, you must need to become a warrior. As a warrior you need to conquer seven defferent kingdoms one by one. If you take the challenge and start your mission after every level, it becomes harder for you to win the next kingdom (become complex and bigger).
